* clear lists only updates the list after a restart of the app. make it an instant change
* should the user see how many are in the group?
* settings tab. - is it really necessary? (probably yeah)
* add more config options
* should probably make the ophonekitd an object and not a function and change the settings straight to it, and not as is now.
* add a call duration field.
* split the populate list function into several sub functions so doing the first todo on get focus would be easy.
